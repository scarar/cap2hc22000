## The convertion acts similar to the hashcat.net website. 
## The .hc22000 will be added to the end of the file so just type in the name of the output file.
## example: 
## python3 cap2hc22000.py input.cap output
## file called output.hc22000 will be created and print out information about the cap file that was being converted. 
## Reference:

## cap2hc22000-menu.py (Updated)

## This will detect the .cap files inside the directery and convert ALL or a specific file and create a directery called converted_files that will 
## have the converted .hc22000 files inside.
